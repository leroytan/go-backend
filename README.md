# go-backend
 This is a backend server built with go, it is a webforum that supports basic CRUD, authentication, and tagging(WIP).

## Note:
This is a sample project!

## Requirements
Download go from https://go.dev/dl/


## To run the server:
### Step 1:
In your terminal, run the following commands:
```
go build
./go-backend.exe
```
### Step 2:
Create a .env file <br/>
This file will handle sensitive information <br/>
Since this is a sample project, I have included a .env.template file <br/>
Change the .env.template file to a .env file <br/>
